# Robot Comments

We are extending Gerrit to better support comments generated by automated
systems ("robot comments"). Robot comments will be specifically visualized in
the UI and users will be able to apply filters on them. Robot comments can also
carry generated fixes that users can apply to the change and create a new patch
set.

This talk gives you an introduction to robot comments and how they will be
implemented in Gerrit.
