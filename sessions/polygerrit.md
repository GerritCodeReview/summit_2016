# An Update on PolyGerrit

PolyGerrit has been under development for more than a year and is rapidly
approaching feature parity with the current GWT UI. This talk will give an
overview of what’s been done, what’s left, and what’s next.

Come hear what we’ve learned from a product development standpoint and how you
can help us further improve the best code review experience out there.
